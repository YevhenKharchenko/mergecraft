    <h2 class="policy-title">Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p class="policy-text">
      These terms and conditions applies to the MergeCraft: Mine and Build app
      (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created
      by (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.<br />
      Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically
      agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you
      thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the Application.
      Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the
      Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to
      extract the source code of the Application, translate the Application into
      other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All
      trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property
      rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service
      Provider.<br />
      The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as
      beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to
      modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for
      any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the
      Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.<br />
      The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided
      to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your
      responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
      Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or
      rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and
      limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such
      actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
      compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the
      Application not functioning correctly or at all.<br />
      Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have
      their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and
      Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the
      Application:<br />
         ·   
      <a class="policy-link" href="https://policies.google.com/terms"
        >Google Play Services</a
      ><br />
         ·   
      <a class="policy-link" href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/"
        >Google Analytics for Firebase</a
      ><br />
         ·   
      <a
        class="policy-link"
        href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/plain_text_terms"
        >Facebook</a
      ><br />
      Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility
      for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active
      internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
      provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the
      Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to
      Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.<br />
      If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware
      that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.
      Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
      usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party
      charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such
      charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside
      of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data
      roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are
      using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from
      the bill payer.<br />
      Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for
      your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to
      ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
      battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
      cannot be held responsible.<br />
      In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the
      application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that
      it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
      provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The
      Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
      that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality
      of the application.<br />
      The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The
      application is currently available as per the requirements for the
      operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the
      availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to
      download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The
      Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
      application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
      particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you
      agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The
      Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may
      terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you.
      Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and
      licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using
      the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.
    </p>
    <h2 class="policy-subtitle">Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p class="policy-text">
      The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions.
      Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes.
      The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new
      Terms and Conditions on this page.<br />
      These terms and conditions are effective as of 2025-03-30
